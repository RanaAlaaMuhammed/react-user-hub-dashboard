# React User Hub Dashboard

A user dashboard built with **React** that fetches user data, displays it in a table, allows adding new users, and includes a real-time search functionality with a polished UI.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Fetches user data from a public API (`jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`)
- Responsive, modern UI with blurred background
- Search users by partial name match (case-insensitive)
- Add new users dynamically
- Loading spinner for API calls
- "No results" feedback when no users match the search
- Fully modular React component structure

⏱ Time Spent
I spent approximately 4–5 hours on this project, including:

Project setup and configuration

Component design and implementation

Adding and searching users

UI styling and responsiveness

GitHub setup and troubleshooting

✨ Notes & Improvements
The app currently uses mock data from a public API and local state.

Search supports partial and case-insensitive name matching.

"Add New User" only updates local state; no backend persistence.

Could be improved with:

Form validation

Pagination

Backend connection

UI frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Material UI
